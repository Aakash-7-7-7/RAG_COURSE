      "\n",
      "Instead of relying only on the internal knowledge of a pre-trained language model, a RAG system retrieves relevant information from external sources such as documents, databases, PDFs, or knowledge bases at the time a query is made.\n",
      "\n",
      "This retrieved information is then provided as context to the language model, allowing it to generate responses that are more factual, up-to-date, and domain-specific. This greatly reduces hallucinations and incorrect answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical RAG pipeline includes document ingestion, text chunking, vector embedding, similarity search using vector databases, and final response generation using a large language model.\n",
      "\n",
      "One major advantage of RAG is that knowledge can be updated without retraining the entire model, making it cost-effective and scalable. Because of this, RAG is widely used in chatbots, enterprise search systems, customer support tools, legal and medical assistants, and research applications.\n",
