Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced approach in artificial intelligence that combines information retrieval techniques with generative language models to improve the quality and accuracy of responses.

Instead of relying only on the internal knowledge of a pre-trained language model, a RAG system retrieves relevant information from external sources such as documents, databases, PDFs, or knowledge bases at the time a query is made.

This retrieved information is then provided as context to the language model, allowing it to generate responses that are more factual, up-to-date, and domain-specific. This greatly reduces hallucinations and incorrect answers.

A typical RAG pipeline includes document ingestion, text chunking, vector embedding, similarity search using vector databases, and final response generation using a large language model.

One major advantage of RAG is that knowledge can be updated without retraining the entire model, making it cost-effective and scalable. Because of this, RAG is widely used in chatbots, enterprise search systems, customer support tools, legal and medical assistants, and research applications.

Overall, Retrieval-Augmented Generation bridges the gap between static language models and dynamic real-world information, making AI systems more trustworthy and practical.
