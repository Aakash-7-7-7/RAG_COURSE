Machine Learning (ML) is a fundamental branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for every task.

In machine learning, algorithms analyze historical data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends that help them generalize to new and unseen data.

Machine learning techniques are commonly divided into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each designed to solve different types of problems such as classification, regression, clustering, and control.

Some widely used machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, neural networks, and ensemble models.

The machine learning process usually involves data collection, data cleaning, feature selection, model training, performance evaluation, and deployment.

Machine learning is used in many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, image and speech recognition, fraud detection, healthcare diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, and predictive analytics.

As data continues to grow and computing power increases, machine learning has become a key technology driving intelligent systems that can adapt, learn, and improve over time.
